# AR-Paint-Museum-2
Augmented Reality paint project developed using Unity 3D 2018.4.24f1 & Vuforia SDK.
This is image target based Augmented Reality.
There are 20 markers about art author which shown his/her art up to 12 arts that user can sees.
So I have customized the Image Target Tracker function from Vuforia SDK in order to fit what I need.
